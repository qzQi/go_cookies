## pointer
```go
i:=42
var p *int
p=&42
*p=41
```

## struct
Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer.

To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write (*p).X. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just p.X, without the explicit dereference.但是这个时候我们如何区分指针与struct？

也就是说，struct结构使用.访问data与struct的指针使用.是访问相同的。
Pointer receivers：貌似也不需要区分啊。

Comparing the previous two programs, you might notice that functions with a pointer argument must take a pointer:

while methods with pointer receivers take either a value or a pointer as the receiver when they are called:
